## Flavor Text

**[TODO: Enter your desired challenge flavor text here.]**

This will be the first thing that competitors will read about your challenge.
It should fit the theme of SwampCTF if possible to keep the competitor
invested in the story of the CTF. It doesn't have a defined length, but should
generally be succinct. It's goal it to guide the competitor towards solving
the problem at hand without giving too much away about it.

* Flag: **[TODO: Enter the challenge flag here]**
* Expected difficulty: trivial, easy, medium, hard, very hard **[TODO: Choose One]**

> The format of the "flag" that the players should be able to find within your challenge is "flag{[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{12,40}}". That is, 12 to 40 characters (inclusive) comprising uppercase letters ("A-Z"), lowercase letters ("a-z"), digits ("0-9"), underscores ("_"), and hyphens ("-"), prefixed with the text "flag{", and suffixed by the text "}". If your challenge has more than one valid flag (try to avoid this), let the organizers know as we may have to create a scoring engine to validate the temporary flag before giving a single, real flag.

## Description
**[TODO: Enter a challenge description here]**

A challenge description is for the organizers to understand what the challenge's goals are.
What security topic is this challenge trying to teach? What new techniques, tools, or understanding should competitors walk away with after completing it?
CTFs are first and foremost teaching tools.
When creating a challenge, you _must_ follow the maxims detailed here: http://captf.com/maxims.html and copied here for your convenience.

1. We hack for fun, not for frustration.
1. The scoring mechanism should always be the easiest challenge.
1. Solutions might be a surprise, but recognizing when you have one shouldn't be.
1. When the next step requires a leap of faith, be sure to include a bridge.
1. An homage honors, but duplication doesn't.
1. Learners always win even when winners don't learn.
1. Your point estimates are exactly that until calibrated.
1. Never rely on the survival of a vulnerable server.
1. Competitors are cleverer than you, they also have more time.
1. Learning starts where prior knowledge ends.

Effectively there are more ways to create a bad, boring, frustrating, and un-fun challenge than there are to create good ones.

## Challenge Solution
**[TODO: Enter a challenge solution here]**

Write a complete and descriptive solution (a writeup) to your challenge here.
All challenges must be solvable by the challenge creator and at least one other person.
If you can't solve your own challenge, what hope do others have?

```
Use code blocks when necessary to illustrate your point
```

And `inline code` to highlight commands or variable names.
Link to outside resources [if necessary](https://wikipedia.org), but try to
keep your solution self-contained. Feel free to link to internal files and directories ([`attachments/`](attachments/)) using Markdown.

An organizer should be able to use any included solving scripts or your instructions to replicate your solution. If we cannot, we will kick the problem back to you for additional work.
